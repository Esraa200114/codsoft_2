## Covered Rules
### 1. UI Design: The layout includes an equal button (=), a clear button, a clear-all button (AC), a dot character button (.), number buttons (0â€“9), and operator buttons (+, -, x, /), along with a display area to show the entered numbers, the operation being performed, and the results.
### 2. Number Input: The onNumberClickEvent method captures user input when number buttons are pressed and stores the entered numbers for further processing.
### 3. Operator Selection: The onOperatorClickEvent method enables the selection of arithmetic operators through button clicks and identifies the selected operator.
### 4. Calculation: The onEqualClickEvent method performs arithmetic calculations based on the selected operator and handles division by zero and invalid operations.
### 5. Display: The display area is updated in various parts of the code to show entered numbers, operators, and results. Decimal numbers are handled using the dot character button, and the rounding is performed using the RoundingMode.HALF_UP mode. In this project, I specified the number of decimal places to be 5.
### 6. Clear and Reset: The onAllClearClickEvent method adds an all-clear button to reset the calculator, clearing entered numbers and resetting other variables. While the onClearClickEvent method is used to remove the last entered digit or dot character.
### 7. Error Handling: The code includes various checks for error handling. For example, it shows appropriate messages for invalid input and operations and handles the display of errors in the result area.
### ~ Invalid Operations and input such as:
#### 1. Division by zero.
#### 2. Having more than one decimal point in a number.
#### 3. Entering consecutive decimal points.
#### 4. Exceeding the character limit.
#### 5. Entering consecutive arithmetic operators.
#### 6. Starting with an operator without providing the first operand.
#### 7. Pressing the equal button without entering operands first.
### 8. Handling Overflow: By checking if a BigDecimal variable called output_big_decimal exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by a double data type in Java. If it does, it is considered an overflow, and a flag is set to true to indicate the overflow. The text color of the result field is changed to red and a text saying "Overflow occurred" is displayed in it. Otherwise, if no overflow is detected, the output is formatted using the "FormatBigDecimal" function, and the BigDecimal value is displayed in the result field.
